This is a simple application that shows how to query an API from a web application.

The student_list application is very basic and allows POZOS to show the list of students with their age. student_listâ has two modules:

The first module is a REST API (with necessary basic authentication) that sends the desired list of students based on a JSON file. The second module is a web application written in HTML + PHP that allows the end user to get a list of students. Your job is to build a container for each module and make them interact with each other. The source code of the application can be found in the repository.
